# smwrandomizer-go
A port of authorblue's smwrandomizer (https://github.com/authorblues/smwrandomizer) in Go(lang). 

This project aims to create a suitable offline alternative to the github pages website that is currently available.
Also (mainly, really) it helps me boost my Go skills and understanding of SMW.

## Disclaimer for the Obvious
99.9% of this program's logic was designed by authorblues (and others). I merely "translated" the whole program into another language.

## Download & Installation
Use the `run.sh` script in the repository (download coming soon)
